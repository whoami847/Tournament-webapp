## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant orange (#FF9800) to provide energy and highlight key elements.
- Background color: Dark gray (#121212) to create a modern and immersive gaming atmosphere. Offers good contrast for content display.
- Accent color: Light orange (#FFB74D), an analogous color to the primary, but less saturated, for subtle highlighting and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and readable UI.
- Use clean, minimalist icons to represent different game genres, tournament statuses, and user actions. Orange fill for selected/active states.
- Implement subtle animations such as loading spinners, bracket transitions, and button hover effects to enhance user engagement without being distracting.
